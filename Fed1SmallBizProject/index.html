                            Future School is unlike any other music school created to present day. All though it has a foundation in similar teaching methods, this school varies in teaching the way forward in music, equipping students with a deep sense and understanding of the history of music and where we are headed.

                            Why choose Future School
                        </h2>
                     We work with our students directly to meet their goals. Our approach is to tie in a deeper understanding of music and the culture music comes from as well as the importance of music and art as a cultural vehicle. We approach learning as a blend of traditional education with a hands on real world approach and the flexibility to adapt to how music is changing in real time along with society and technology. This style of teaching has never been done before and the results have been beyond our greatest hopes, with graduates going on to forge succesful and innovative careers in various fields in music including band leading, song writing, music production and engineering, singing and live performance on various instruments.
